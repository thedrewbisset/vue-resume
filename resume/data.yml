about: "Hello, I'm a driven and influential leader, strategic problem solver, and serious
     about using technology to achieve business results. I've been a professional in the field for over 15 years
in various roles as contributor, manager, and executive. Some of my proudest career achievements include:"
achievements: 
  - Grew the startup, Peerfit, from 10-60 people, achieving a Series-C round of funding, and later leading a multi-million dollar acquisition of my team and our proprietary technology platform by Peloton Interactive.
  - Established Peloton's Corporate Wellness business which won customer contracts with SAP, Samsung, and Nasdaq among others and was ranked by 90% of benefit participants as one of their top 3 employer benefits. The product was responsible for adding millions of dollars of incremental revenue to Peloton's business by lowering the customer barrier-to-entry through negotiated rates on hardware / services while increasing employee retention and decreasing healthcare costs through tailored engagement experiences on Peloton's platform aimed at creating workforce connection and wellbeing.
  - Lead the turnaround of the Ecommerce Engineering zone at Peloton as business challenges and changes in senior leadership led to layoffs, subsequent waves of voluntary attrition, plummiting stock value, and a material shift in company priorities and culture. During this time I helped reboot the engineering team's strategy leading to successfully backfilling over 20 positions, restructuring the org to be better aligned with business priorities, sponsoring over a dozen promotions including a Senior Staff Engineer and Engineering Director position that I sponsored directly with executive leadership, and drove commerce results that helped Peloton improve its financial results by hundreds of millions of dollars year over year.
